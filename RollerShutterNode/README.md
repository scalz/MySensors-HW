# MyRollerShutter

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scalz/MySensors-HW/development/RollerShutterNode/img/Rollershutter13.jpg" alt="RollershutterNode"> 

This is a board for controlling rollershutters (0-100%) and detecting end stops with ACS712 for current sense of motor. 
It can control 3-wire motor only (Power, Up, Down wires), DC or AC, 12 to 230V. It's fine for me as I'm using AC motor. But this board can't work with 2wire DC motor.
You can connect 3 push buttons (UP/DOWN/STOP) and/or external i2c device (for tactile, gesture...). 

Of course, it can also be used as a relay board.

It is derived in two versions :

- NRF24 smd
- RFM69CW

I am using it with Mysensors lib. It's fun :)

### Important Note : I share this work for educational purpose. Be very careful with this. It's an AC Board which can be lethal. If you don't know what you are doing, I can't tell you enough to not do anything.

#### Q&A about my personal choice
##### Why not an ESP?
- I like these chips. But I don't want wifi for my rollershutter nodes. I prefer to use subghz radio+atsha signing ic.

##### Why current sensor for endstop detection?
- There are other option for just detecting a simple trigger, sure. I looked at it briefly, there was not a so big footprint saving, and I thought the current sensor would add more verstality to the board.

##### Why so much capa, using filtering for analog etc..
- some ferrites, caps etc. are not all mandatory. they help to improve things but without some parts it works well. It's there, in case, for debug, and still useful when there are some footprints available.

etc..

Finally :

- as each new thing I make, I enjoy the new challenge.
- I have tried to make a board dedicated for RollershutterNode with autocalibration, with as much features/options/versatility I could with the available footprint. 

#### About the ACS current sensor

ACS reading measurement results, from 0 to 1000W by 100W step :

For fun, this is the light bulbs I have used to do my measurements (5 lights bulbs can be powered separately, the other row in one time, so it's possible to do 100W steps)

For detail about opamp circuit see schematic.

### Example of use of this board : RollershutterNode 

#### How is the Rollershutter motor controlled:

On-board, there are 2x10Amp Relays. Rollershutter motor don't use 10Amp of course, nor 5Amp. May we expect no need of snubber, if using over rated relays? I hope :) If mandatory for you then, it should be external, not enough space onboard. That said, for a simple relay board too, you can control lot of thing with 10amp.

So, we have 2 relays, for the rollershutter:

- 1x NO  which enable/disable power on the second relay. It is like "Stop Motor".
- 1X NO-NC that you can toggle, and drive Up, or Down the rollershutter motor. Remember this relay needs to be enabled by the previous one.
    So relays are "interlocked", you can't enable "Up" and "Down" outputs to motor at same time and burn your motor.

#### How to open/close 0-100%

We need to detect the up and down endstops. It is managed by the onboard ACS7125 sensor. It will senses the motor current flow and we will read it with ADC on arduino. 
When motor is active, there is a power consumption. And when an up or down end is toggled, the motor stops (because of mechanical switch...). There is no power consumption. 

As you can see, with ACS712, we can know in which state we are. We are able to read some kind of power consuption curve too if needed and no mechanical ends switch available..
So, we need to know how long it takes to open the rollershutter, and to close (it may be not the exact timing open vs close time). 

#### Example sketch 

Note: the example sketch is for Mysensors v2.x. You can find it in example folder. It is state machine based, so no blocking loop. It's not very polished but it's working. I miss time, too much ideas&projects..I will look at it later. 

1. You just need to config your settings in the MyNodeDefinition.h
2. The ShutterSM.h and .cpp are the state machine for the shutter. You don't need to modify it, there are default settings.
3. State and settings of rollershutter are stored in eeprom.

The sketch present the following Mysensors CHILD_IDs, presented to a controller for instance :

| CHILD_ID | Description | 
|---|---|
| CHILD_ID_ROLLERSHUTTER | handle UP/DOWN/STOP/PERCENT |
| CHILD_ID_AUTOCALIBRATION | remotely start a calibration |
| CHILD_ID_TEMPERATURE | onboard temperature sensor, to monitor board&Hilink temperature |
| CHILD_ID_ENDSTOP | endstop. for debugging in case...Set it to simulate an endstop during calibration and tell the node that the shutter has reached the endstop (in case no mechanical switch etc..) |
| CHILD_ID_PERCENT | Rollershutter PERCENT for controller which are not Mysensors 2.0 compliant yet |
| CHILD_ID_CURRENT |Current sensor value, for debugging.. |

**At first launch**, the node will use the default values in the state machine and will know it's not calibrated. So, you can launch a calibration. That will automatically :

1. fully open the shutter.
2. fully close it and measure travel time.
3. fully open it and measure the travel time.
4. Done. Yeah! Parameters are stored in eeprom. 
5. If you push Up button, that will try to fully open. Down, Stop buttons will do their job too. The node store the new position in eeprom. From your controller, set a PERCENT and that will open as you want your shutter. so fun, so cool :)
etc..
